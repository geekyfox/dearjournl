    <a href="#how">
        How it works?
    </a>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    So, here's how it works. Go to 
    <a href="https://dear-jour.nl">dear-jour.nl</a>, and you'll get a
    question. Then, think about this question. If it doesn't resonate
    with what's going through your head today, that's fine, just
    click "I want another one!"
</div>

<div class="answer">
    Then, grab your paper journal and a pen and write down your
    thoughts. Or, open a file on your computer and write down your
    thoughts. Or, get together with a circle of friends and discuss your
    thoughts. Or, write a blog post and put it online so the entire
    world can see it. Or, go to a cafe, order a cup of matcha latte and
    a piece of chocolate cake, write a sonnet on a napkin, and then go to
    the river bank, burn the napkin, and throw the ashes into the water.
    Or, redirect this question to The Universe and wait for her to give
    you a sign. Whatever works for you.
</div>

<div class="answer">
    You can do it every morning, or every evening, or every Thursday, or
    every time you feel stressed and confused. Whatever works for you,
    there are no rules except the ones you invent for your own convenience.

    Writing it down almost feels embarrassing, but we live in
    embarrassing times, so here it goes.

    That's why if you've been journaling for some time and then decided
    to dump your annoying spouse and quit your dreary job to become a yoga
    teacher in Patagonia, please make sure your in-laws and your
    colleagues don't knock on my door to tell it's my fault.
</div>

<div class="answer">
    Jokes aside, if you're going through a rough patch and you're one
    funny question away from injuring yourself, committing a crime or taking
    your own life, I beg you to seek help from your friends, your family,
    and/or qualified mental health professionals.

    <a id="why"></a>
    <a href="#why#">
        Why it works this way?
    </a>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    I admit, this isn't how you'd typically imagine a journaling app to look
    like in 2025. Perhaps you'd expect it to have:

    <ul>
        <li>
            A clumsy web interface that changes every other week and
            occasionally erases a paragraph you've just written for
            no apparent reason.
        </li>
        <li>
            A mobile app which is only available for Apple devices and
            doesn't allow to search the earlier notes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Passive-aggressive reminders like "you haven't been journaling
            for three days, you make our mascot sad" and other tricks to
            optimise the nonsense KPIs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Automation to feed your journal entries into some "AI" so that
            when you write "Joe is full of crap," Joe gets immediately
            shelled with toilet paper advertisements... Because he's full
            of crap... You get it? You get it?!
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    I wouldn't use such an app. And my primary concern won't even be
    privacy but ergonomics. I mean, obviously, I wouldn't feel terribly
    comfortable uploading my deepest secrets to some random online
    service where they can be sold, stolen, leaked, or misused. However,
    if usability was superb, I might've given in. And if the whole
    internet knows that I sometimes regret not taking my high school
    crush out for a date, that'd be embarrassing, but that's a risk I
    can accept.
</div>

<div class="answer">
    However. I know upfront that it can't possibly be very convenient
    for me to use. Look, I'm turning forty this year, and I have
    long-standing habits when it comes to writing. I have two favourite
    tools. When working on a text that's likely to be developed into
    something public (like a blog article) or when I feel like typing,
    I use the editor called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a>.
    When working on a text that's unlikely to be made public, or when I
    feel like scribbling, I use fineliner pens and Paperblanks notebooks.
</div>

<div class="answer">
    Compared to those, a very finely designed website might be "tolerably
    bad", but even then, I don't see a reason to settle for "tolerably
    bad" when I can use what works best for me. Oh, and any mobile app
    that relies on the screen keyboard is pretty much unusable.
</div>

<div class="answer">
    That's why I made a piece of software I would use myself because it
    solves a problem I have. And the problem I had with journaling and
    other forms of focused meditation is that the blank page can be very
    confusing. Some days, not much is happening in my life, so I don't
    know what to mention. Other days, too much is happening in my life,
    so I don't even know where to begin. So I can't develop a steady
    rhythm, and then I end up doing nothing, and that's just sad.
</div>

<div class="answer">
    Having a quirky question to focus on helps me a lot, and I genuinely
    hope it helps you as well.

    Nope, not at all. No functional cookies, no tracking cookies, no "we

    I was just about to build that part, and then I got distracted by
    things that I find exciting.
