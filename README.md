# Dear Journal...

This repository hosts the source code for
[dear-jour.nl](https://dear-jour.nl) website.

The website has [an instructions page](https://dear-jour.nl/qa.html), which
I think is pretty good.

Also, it's an ongoing exercise in building "an app for Zen meditation that
must itself have Zen nature," so it was a conscious process of stripping
down the feature scope until almost nothing was left. So, yep, there are a
few hundred lines of HTML-CSS-JavaScript with no "AI" features, no covert
data collection, no backend infrastructure at all, and, most of all, no
plans to ever introduce any of that.

Of course, if you have some nice quirky questions you'd like to add to the
list, you're very welcome to submit a PR!
